# ü§î Thoughts

### I am a runner

I continued running four times a week, and it feels like running is now part of my identity. I miss it when I haven't ran in a couple of days. I feel happier and more relaxed when I have running as part of my identity. I would like it to stay.

It's funny - someone asked me the other day if I was a runner, I was about to say "not really" but I have accomplished a lot when I think back on these cycles. I have been running four times a week for 37 weeks. I am a Runner!

My Strava Fitness has increased to 90 from 69. this has been through the tough cold months but I set out some fun activities to motivate me. I wanted to run around Cramond Island, a small island, near Leith, where you can walk along a causeway to the island when the tide is out. I felt like this added an extra sense of adventure, but in reality, the tide is out for ~4 hours so as long as you plan it, you will be fine. I planned it out and asked a good pal to come with me. I wanted to run with someone as I had enjoyed the company in the previous cycle. I manage to do this run twice, back to back, right at the start of the year. It is also a half marathon distance, it is no easy run, the legs were tired that week.

After Kat and I had finished watching the Trainspotting movies, I suddenly had a burst of motivation to run up Arthur's seat like in [the film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PqESFKdv4I&ab_channel=SonyPicturesReleasingUK). I managed to do this twice this cycle, it is tough, but I can feel the benefit of hills.

I also started an "active group" at work to get the team feeling a bit more connected and hopefully happier. We aimed for a personal goal of 1hr a week of "active time" and a team goal of 10hrs. The "active time" can be anything; walking, running, cycling, swimming. The main aim is not to be too competitive and work as a team. We have hit our targets, and I feel it is working as a team bonding activity. We have recently celebrated someone's first 5k!

I now feel running is part of my identity, I will stick to four times a week and add some fun goals to support it in the next cycle.

### I am a reader

After struggling to find time to read, I have adopted a simple but effective tip that [Lynne](https://twitter.com/lynnewritescode) shared on the previous cycle's post

> "try to read a couple of pages here and there every day"

This method is proving to be highly effective for me. I am making significant progress and looking to finish it in the next couple of weeks.

I am also taking notes as I intend to write a book review. There are many thought-provoking ideas that the book raises. The ideas on goal setting and expectations, I found especially useful for this blog. The main point it presents is not to tie your happiness to goals. We blame ourselves for not achieving a goal, but fate or luck has intervened, and we think this is our fault. It is sometimes nice to have a goal, but it should not be what makes us happy in life.

It also has a section on happiness's history covering Socrates, Aristotle, Christianity, Marxism and others, which I found very interesting and enjoyable.

I'm going to keep working on this book, aiming to finish in the next six weeks and have started another book.

### I am a blogger

Even though I haven't published any new blog posts, that is not to say I haven't been working on blogging. I have created a blog post ready to be published, but I thought it was too close to this one. To avoid having posts published too close to one another, I have chosen to schedule that one later in the week.

The post coming later this week was the first time I made my own diagrams to illustrate the concepts discussed. I think they turned out quite well, but I'll wait to see what others think.

More interestingly, I have joined a blogging community for developers, which has been amazing! I joined the [Blogging for Devs](https://bloggingfordevs.com/) community to keep me accountable, generate ideas and generally keep this blog moving forward. So far, it has been pretty good; there are many like-minded folks, blogging themed events, and I have been enjoying the accountability sessions.

For the next cycle, I have joined the Bi-Weekly blogger's group, which means I should have three posts by the end.

### I am a learner

I sadly did not finish the "[UI Design for Developers](https://designcode.io/ui-design)" course. Since learning Figma and design is import to me, I will make it one of my main goals for the next cycle. Possibly even create a review post about it.

I also want to improve my typing speed and aim higher than what I am currently typing - 50 wpm. I will add this to the goals of the next cycle too.

So what non-goal events have happened?
