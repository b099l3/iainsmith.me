Cycle 6 was from February 14th - 16th August. If you want to know more about my goal cycles, this [post](https://iainsmith.me/newsletter/0) has all the details.

<Alert type={`info`} icon={'üß†'} title={'My mental wellbeing'}>

This cycle was due to finish in March, but I decided to take a break from writing. I had put a lot of pressure on myself, in and outside of work. I also started to, what I think, get depressed and wasn't having the best episodes or thoughts. It began as waves of feeling isolated, lonely, worthless and negative feelings towards myself. It still seems to come and go in waves, and I am trying my best to see what causes it and help manage it. It is baffling looking back on what I was thinking about and how upset I was getting with these irrational thoughts.

I wasn't talking to people about it as I had the idea that people don't want to help, as it is a burden on them to deal with someone else's problems, so I just shut people off. I read this article, [Men Have No Friends and Women Bear the Burden](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/a27259689/toxic-masculinity-male-friendships-emotional-labor-men-rely-on-women/), and thought I shouldn't bring this up with my girlfriend as I don't want to burden her. But after a couple of conversations with her, she told me this article is not the relationship we have, we both help and support each other, and it is not good to just shut anyone off. So, I started to talk, and after a couple of good conversations, I have got myself out of the negative state for the time being. I have been feeling somewhat ok the last couple of weeks. It will probably come back, but I know how to communicate my feelings properly to help prevent it.

A friend of mine helped me realise that I am very self-deprecating and analyse situations to the point where I think alot of people hate me or find me annoying. I can take a little insignificant action as a mark of dislike and be analysing it weeks later. He helped reassure me that part of my past has caused that, and he doesn't think of me in that way and likes being around me. Just some simple words like that helped me much more than I thought. Maybe it was just some self-reassurance I needed from someone, but those words helped me alot.

I moved to Edinburgh at the start of the Covid lockdown and haven't seen any of my friends, which has affected my mental health and made me think about my friendships. I listened to alot of podcasts talking about friendship and found this one helpful, [Understanding Male Friendships | The Art of Manliness](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5hk3VO14h7TVHWkpYjXCqD?si=J3WLZQdEQM67zlzA7q_kvg&dl_branch=1). The title is not great but let me explain. It shows how men interact in very general terms, shoulder to shoulder, i.e., doing something together, watching sports, playing a game. It contrasts this with friendships that women have face-to-face, i.e., grabbing a coffee or having a phone call. Although this is very generalising, I feel I do a bit of both, so there are some relevant points raised in this podcast. I also think it varies on the person, not the gender. Some of my female friends act more like the "male" style shoulder-to-shoulder, and some of my male friends can talk on the phone for hours. But one takeaway is it is hard to create new friendships.

As a man in his 30s, it is hard to make new friends, and I think alot of people are lonely or have small friend groups. The same friend who helped me told me he doesn't have time for toxic friendships and only keeps in touch with people who don't belittle him or have a one-upmanship style of friendship. I want to follow that mindset, and I want to build and maintain my friendships, like any other relationship in my life. It will be challenging but rewarding. I might write a blog post on some of the points raised and how I am tackling them but let's get this goal cycle post done first!

And now back to the goal cycle.
