One week untilÂ [Next.js Conf](https://nextjs.org/conf)! I'm taking a quick break from recording, editing, and producing content to share a behind-the-scenes look at the event.

## Behind The Scenes

Virtual events are the final boss for DevRel. It's the ultimate combination of community and content creation. On the community side, there's over 60,000 folks registered to hear talks fromÂ [40+ of the brightest minds](https://twitter.com/vercel/status/1449109009902948358)Â in the Next.js community. On the content side, I've been helping plan, write, produce, film, and edit multiple talks for the event, including the keynote.

Four months ago, I was a DevRel team of one. Since then, I've hiredÂ [four](https://twitter.com/delba_oliveira)Â [amazing](https://twitter.com/steventey)Â [Developer](https://twitter.com/Nutlope)Â [Advocates](https://twitter.com/steph_dietz_)Â to join my team. I need to write an entire post on scaling DevRel teams... but needless to say, they've been a key part of making this event happen.

With aÂ [new coat of paint](https://twitter.com/leeerob/status/1447590971634487303)Â and some work, I've transformed my office background for the event. I'm most excited about my talk with Kelsey Hightower, where we'll show off a new feature coming to Next.js ðŸ‘€

## (Another) Fresh Coat of Paint

Speaking of painting,Â [I redesigned my site](https://iainsmith.me/). It's now running my preferred stack:

- **Framework**:Â [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- **Database**:Â [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/)
- **ORM**:Â [Prisma](https://prisma.io/)
- **Authentication**:Â [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/)
- **Deployment**:Â [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- **Content**:Â [MDX](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx)
- **Styling**:Â [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

Along with the redesign, I converted everything to TypeScript and added Motion One toÂ [animate my Spotify player](https://twitter.com/leeerob/status/1446860103353835524). I even had some funÂ [CSS deep dives](https://twitter.com/leeerob/status/1445033787646046216)Â during development.
